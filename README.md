# FocusBar

FocusBar is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to enhance your browsing experience by allowing you to add a customizable highlight bar overlay to any webpage. This extension helps users stay focused on specific sections of content while scrolling through a page.

## Features

- **Customizable Highlight Bar**: Adds a movable and resizable bar to the webpage to visually focus on specific sections.
- **On-Demand Activation**: The extension operates only when triggered by the user.
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Move the bar vertically across the page as needed.
- **Height Adjustment**: Resize the bar to suit your preferences.
- **Opacity Adjustment**: Change the transparency of the highlight bar using a slider.
- **Color Picker**: Customize the color of the highlight bar.
- **Close Button**: Quickly toggle off the highlight bar with a user-friendly close button.
- **Lightweight Design**: FocusBar runs entirely locally within your browser, ensuring minimal resource usage.
- **Privacy-First**: No data collection, tracking, or external API calls.
- **Caching Settings**: Automatically saves the position, height, color, and opacity of the highlight bar for future use.
